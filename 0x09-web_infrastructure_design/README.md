## Requirements
* For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
* This project will be manually reviewed:
* As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
* Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use imgur but feel free to use anything you want).
* For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
* After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box
* You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
* Focus on what you are being asked:
* Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
* Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
* In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked
